WakeUp,Narrator,"You wake up with an immense, violent pain in your shoulderblades."
WakeUp,Narrator,"You go to scream, but as you jolt up, Maria is there."
WakeUp,Narrator,She puts her hand over your mouth.
WakeUp,Maria,"Stay quiet, don't freak out. I understand what's been happening to you."
WakeUp,Maria,Take your shirt off.
WakeUp,Vela,What!? No!
WakeUp,Narrator,She pulls out a knife and makes a gesture like she's ready to cut it off herself.
WakeUp,Vela,Okay! Don't stab me!
WakeUp,Narrator,You slowly pull off your shirt and peek a glance over your shoulders to see if there's any sign of what's causing the searing pain on your back.
WakeUp,Maria,I knew it.
WakeUp,Narrator,You're growing wings.
WakeUp,Maria,You got infected. That's what's been going on all week.
WakeUp,Vela,"Please don't kill me, I didn't know where else to go! I don't have anyone else, I would never hurt anyone at the camp-I haven't hurt anyone!"
WakeUp,Maria,Shhhhhhh shh shh shh...
WakeUp,Maria,"You're going to be fine, Vela. Nobody else will know."
WakeUp,Narrator,"She undoes a strap on her shoulder and the back of her jacket folds away to reveal a gargantuan pair of dark, leathery wings."
WakeUp,Maria,I know how to keep these things a secret.
WakeUp,Narrator,You sit there for a few seconds in shock.
WakeUp,Maria,You said you haven't hurt anyone yet. Does that mean you haven't tasted blood?
WakeUp,Vela,Not even animal blood!
WakeUp,Maria,"You must be starving! We'll go out today and I'll show you some more or less humane ways to keep the bloodthirst at bay. Thankfully, the development of wings tends to be one of the more managable periods of Vampuberty."
WakeUp,Narrator,"She's grinning like a maniac, clearly she's been waiting to share that pun for years."
WakeUp,Maria,"You'll make it through this fine, Vela. I'm going to take care of you."
WakeUp,Narrator,"You're blown away, on the verge of tears when Maria leans in and wraps her arms around you in the biggest, most painful, most life-changing hug you've ever received. "
WakeUp,Narrator,"You break down and start to cry, letting out all the pain you've been holding in since the incident as for just a moment, all of your fear, your anxiety, your crippling worries for the future wash out of you."
WakeUp,Narrator,"In this moment, you feel loved. "
WakeUp,Narrator,"And that's enough to get you through today, at least."
WakeUp,Narrator,The End
