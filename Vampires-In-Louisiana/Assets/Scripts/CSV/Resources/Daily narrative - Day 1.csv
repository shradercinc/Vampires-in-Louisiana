,,
Story,Narrator,You got bit.
,,
AilHint,Vela,I gotta cover this thing somehow. I need time to figure out what to do with myself.
,,
NightTime,Vela,"By the time your head hit the pillow, the entire wound had miraculously closed. Only a slight scar remained. You went to bed."
,,
MostPosResponse,Mama,"Hey, girl. Rise and shine. I was starting to wonder where you were. "

,Mama,I've been looking for one myself. That one's lovely on you.
,Narrator,She smiles and faces back to her work.
,Mama,The people 'round camp have missed you. You should go say hi to everyone before you head back in.
,,
PosResponse,Mama,How are you feeling? You've been locked in your little cave for a while now. You got a fever?
,Narrator,She reaches toward your forehead with the back of her hand to feel your temperature. You immediately swing back before she can feel how icy-cold your skin is.
,Mama,Whoa whoa whoa! Nevermind then! 
,Narrator,"She played it off jokingly, but you can tell that she was a little taken aback. "
,Vela,I'm just on a walk. Still feel like crap.
,Mama,Alright. I'm here if you need me.
,Vela,I know. Thanks Ma. 
,,
MidResponse,Mama,Vela. Its been a bit since you were out here! 
,Mama,"Good lord, you look like crap. What happened?"
,Vela,Nothing major. 
,Mama,How very non-specific. I don't believe you.
,Narrator,"She eyes you up and down, looking for a sign of anything that could've happened. As she's about to ask something, you spit out an excuse."
,Vela,It's none of your business. 
,Narrator,She frowns. Intensely. You regret the way that it came out.

,Narrator,"She reaches toward you, but you dodge before she can do anything. She looks angry in response to this."
,Vela,Uh- It's nothing. It was supposed to be funny!
,Narrator,The lie works with little to no success. 
,Mama,What is wrong with you? You're scaring people. You're scaring me. Go get cleaned up.
,Mama,You're lucky I'm not Maria. She'd have shot you dead by now.
