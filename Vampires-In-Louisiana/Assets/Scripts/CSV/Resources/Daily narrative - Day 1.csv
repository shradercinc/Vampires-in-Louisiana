WakeUp,Narrator,Your head is killing you. There is a sharp pain in your neck that won't go away.
WakeUp,Narrator,The events of the past night flash before your eyes in pinpricks. 
WakeUp,Narrator,Two glowing eyes. A dozen needles in your neck. A million bats flying around inside your head.
WakeUp,Narrator,Your knuckles are bruised from struggle and you're lucky you got out alive.
WakeUp,Narrator,There isn't really time to dwell on it though. You got bit.
WakeUp,Narrator,And now you've gotta deal with it.
WakeUp,Narrator,The sun is glaring down on your face from a broken window as you stir awake. 
WakeUp,Narrator,"Luckily, you managed to crawl back to camp last night without anyone seeing your wound. "
WakeUp,Narrator,"It was a stupid decision to go out on your own, but it'd been so long since you had any privacy. The apocalypse really doesn't let people have any alone time."
WakeUp,Narrator,The campgrounds have been suffocating. You've always been the odd one out.
WakeUp,Narrator,"Masking whatever your insides have been telling you, just going along with what everyone expects."
WakeUp,Narrator,Parading around like you know what you're doing gets exhausting.
WakeUp,Narrator,"This is the result of that, I suppose."
WakeUp,Narrator,Inside and outside are matching now. Vampire symptoms will be hitting you soon.

AilHint,Vela,"Ugh, god."
AilHint,Narrator,"You peel yourself up from your bed. In the reflection of what is left of the shattered window, you see the bite mark on your neck."
AilHint,Narrator,"It felt like a bunch of pins and needles, but it looks like someone took a beartrap to you. The wound scabbed over and stopped bleeding. It still looks awful, though. "
AilHint,Vela,I gotta cover this thing somehow. In a way that won't make it obvious. I need time to figure out what to do with myself.
,,
NightTime,Narrator,"By the time your head hits the pillow, the entire wound had miraculously closed. Only a slight scar remained. "
NightTime,Narrator,Thoughts race through your head as you contemplate the events of the past few days.
NightTime,Narrator,What are you going to do? How much worse is it going to get? Are people going to find you out? Are you going to be exiled?
NightTime,Narrator,"You stay up for hours fearing the worst, but eventually, you pass out."
,,
MAMA_MPR,Mama,"Hey, girl. Rise and shine. I was starting to wonder where you were. "
MAMA_MPR,Narrator,"She glances at the scarf wrapped around your neck, hiding the bite. "
MAMA_MPR,Mama,"Oh, where did you find that scarf? Was that from scavenging recently?"
MAMA_MPR,Vela,"Oh, this? Uh, yeah. Got lucky."
MAMA_MPR,Mama,I've been looking for one myself. That one's lovely on you.
MAMA_MPR,Narrator,She smiles and faces back to her work.
MAMA_MPR,Mama,The people 'round camp have missed you. You should go say hi to everyone before you head back to your tent for the night.
,,
MAMA_PR,Mama,How are you feeling? You've been locked in your little cave for a while now. You got a fever?
MAMA_PR,Narrator,She reaches toward your forehead with the back of her hand to feel your temperature. You immediately swing back before she can feel how icy-cold your skin is.
MAMA_PR,Mama,Whoa whoa whoa! Nevermind then! 
MAMA_PR,Narrator,"She played it off jokingly, but you can tell that she was a little taken aback. "
MAMA_PR,Vela,I'm just on a walk. Still feel like crap.
MAMA_PR,Mama,Alright. I'm here if you need me. You should head back to your tent as soon as you get done out here to rest up.
MAMA_PR,Vela,I know. Thanks Ma. 
,,
MAMA_MR,Mama,Vela. Its been a bit since you were out here! 
MAMA_MR,Mama,"Good lord, you look like crap. What happened?"
MAMA_MR,Vela,Nothing major. 
MAMA_MR,Mama,How very non-specific. I don't believe you.
MAMA_MR,Narrator,"She eyes you up and down, looking for a sign of anything that could've happened. As she's about to ask something, you spit out an excuse."
MAMA_MR,Vela,It's none of your business. 
MAMA_MR,Narrator,She frowns. Intensely. You regret the way that it came out. 
MAMA_MR,Mama,"Right. Well please make sure you get some rest tonight, we'll send you some stuff to your tent."
,,
MAMA_NR,Vela,"Hey, Ma. "
MAMA_NR,Narrator,"She looks up at you from her work and jumps, eyes wide at your condition. "
MAMA_NR,Mama,"Jesus Vela, you scared me. Where is all that blood coming from? "
MAMA_NR,Narrator,"She reaches toward you, but you dodge before she can do anything. She looks angry in response to this."
MAMA_NR,Vela,Uh- It's nothing. It was supposed to be funny!
MAMA_NR,Narrator,The lie works with little to no success. 
MAMA_NR,Mama,What is wrong with you? You're scaring people. You're scaring me. Go get cleaned up in your tent or get some rest before you walk around looking like that.
MAMA_NR,Mama,You're lucky I'm not Maria. She'd have shot you dead by now. 
,,
MAMA_MNR,Vela,"Hey, Ma. "
MAMA_MNR,Narrator,"She looks up at you from her work and jumps, eyes wide at your condition. "

JEAN_MPR,Jean,Vela! You've finally crawled out. Back in the swing of things?
JEAN_MPR,Vela,Mostly. I'm still a little-
JEAN_MPR,Jean,Well! There is always stuff to be done! We're here if you feel up to it. I've been struggling to find enough tomato soup cans to work on this new receipe...
JEAN_MPR,Narrator,"You nod, holding back a slight cringe. You never feel up to it, but least of all now. Jean has a problem with asking for help and then promptly complaining about said help when it arrives."
JEAN_MPR,Narrator,"You can't really say that, though."
JEAN_MPR,Vela,Of course.
JEAN_MPR,Narrator,"As you turn away, you can sense passive-aggressive fog floating above the chef."
,,
JEAN_PR,Narrator,"As you walk towards the kitchen, you see Jean, the camp's favorite chef, bustling around the tent and mumbling to himself."
JEAN_PR,Jean,Didn't I tell Maria to make sure no one waltzes in here while I'm in the middle of my-
JEAN_PR,Jean,"Oh, Vela. Good to see you're feeling a little better."
JEAN_PR,Vela,"Yeah, thanks. "
JEAN_PR,Narrator,You only just realize he's holding about 30 different root vegetables in one arm.
JEAN_PR,Jean,I'm a little busy. Actually a lot busy. Talk later. So many vegetables.
JEAN_PR,Narrator,Jean sinks further into the back of the kitchen and becomes completely unreachable. You take that as a sign to leave.
,,
JEAN_MR,Jean,"Yikes- oh, uh. Sorry. You don't look too hot."
JEAN_MR,Jean,What are you doing out here? You should go back inside.
JEAN_MR,Jean,"Or at the very least, get out of my kitchen."
,,
JEAN_NR,Narrator,The chef briefly glaced up at you and immediately looked away with repulsion. 
JEAN_NR,Jean,"You know, it's not wise to be in the kitchen when you're sick."
JEAN_NR,Narrator,"He stares straight at you, not even trying to hold back irritation."
JEAN_NR,Narrator,It would be wise to keep up appearances. People are quick to judge.
JEAN_NR,Narrator,You back away from the kitchen and he shuffles back to his work alone.

RAND_PR,Camper,"Hey, Vela right? Good to see you up and about!"
,,
RAND_MR,Camper,"Hey, uh, stay safe out there."
RAND_MR,Narrator,"Beneath the venear of polite expression, you sense a clear note of concern"
,,
RAND_NR,Camper,"Woah shit, what bear mauled you?"
