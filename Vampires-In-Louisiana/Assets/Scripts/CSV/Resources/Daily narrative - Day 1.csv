WakeUp,Narrator,Your head is killing you. There is a sharp pain in your neck that won't go away.
,,
Story,Narrator,You got bit.
,,
AilHint,Vela,I gotta cover this thing somehow. I need time to figure out what to do with myself.
,,
NightTime,Narrator,"By the time your head hit the pillow, the entire wound had miraculously closed. Only a slight scar remained. You went to bed."
,,
MAMA_MPR,Mama,"Hey, girl. Rise and shine. I was starting to wonder where you were. "
MAMA_MPR,Narrator,"She glances at the scarf wrapped around your neck, hiding the bite. "
MAMA_MPR,Mama,"Oh, where did you find that scarf? Did you go scavenging recently?"
MAMA_MPR,Vela,"Oh, this? Uh, yeah. Got lucky."
MAMA_MPR,Mama,I've been looking for one myself. That one's lovely on you.
MAMA_MPR,Narrator,She smiles and faces back to her work.
MAMA_MPR,Mama,The people 'round camp have missed you. You should go say hi to everyone before you head back in.
,,
MAMA_PR,Mama,How are you feeling? You've been locked in your little cave for a while now. You got a fever?
MAMA_PR,Narrator,She reaches toward your forehead with the back of her hand to feel your temperature. You immediately swing back before she can feel how icy-cold your skin is.
MAMA_PR,Mama,Whoa whoa whoa! Nevermind then! 
MAMA_PR,Narrator,"She played it off jokingly, but you can tell that she was a little taken aback. "
MAMA_PR,Vela,I'm just on a walk. Still feel like crap.
MAMA_PR,Mama,Alright. I'm here if you need me.
MAMA_PR,Vela,I know. Thanks Ma. 
,,
MAMA_MR,Mama,Vela. Its been a bit since you were out here! 
MAMA_MR,Mama,"Good lord, you look like crap. What happened?"
MAMA_MR,Vela,Nothing major. 
MAMA_MR,Mama,How very non-specific. I don't believe you.
MAMA_MR,Narrator,"She eyes you up and down, looking for a sign of anything that could've happened. As she's about to ask something, you spit out an excuse."
MAMA_MR,Vela,It's none of your business. 
MAMA_MR,Narrator,She frowns. Intensely. You regret the way that it came out. 
MAMA_MR,Mama,Right. 
,,
MAMA_NR,Vela,"Hey, Ma. "
MAMA_NR,Narrator,"She looks up at you from her work and jumps, eyes wide at your condition. "
MAMA_NR,Mama,"Jesus Vela, you scared me. Where is all that blood coming from? "
MAMA_NR,Narrator,"She reaches toward you, but you dodge before she can do anything. She looks angry in response to this."
MAMA_NR,Vela,Uh- It's nothing. It was supposed to be funny!
MAMA_NR,Narrator,The lie works with little to no success. 
MAMA_NR,Mama,What is wrong with you? You're scaring people. You're scaring me. Go get cleaned up.
MAMA_NR,Mama,You're lucky I'm not Maria. She'd have shot you dead by now.
